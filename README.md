# Endless Math
A web application intended to allow users to practice simple mathematics “endlessly”. 

## Setup
*Project is under development.

## Overview
- This project began as a way to practice coding in python outside of my studies. Please see the repository "Python Projects", section "Endless Math" for more details.
- This project is currently in development. I hope to apply what I continue to learn about full stack web application development to this project. I would like for this project to acheive the following goals. 

###### Graphic User Interface/Increase User Engagement: 
- Id like to shift user interaction from IDE terminal to a website. This should increase user engagement as it should be more easily run/interactive. 
- Initially, I intended to make use of my original python code. Further reflection has led me to the conclusion that it instead should be coded in JavaScript. This will improve the user experience as they will no longer require python to be installed on their computers for my code to run.

###### Accessiblity: 
- Deeply personal goal of mine, I believe its important to cater to individual needs. 
- Id like to learn about and update my code accordingly to better suit various accessibility requirements.

###### Possible Future Features
- Allowing for more complex mathematic functions: Multiplication/Division/Fraction etc.
- Create a server-side database using Flask to save and store user credentials/scores. I could implement a system of trading “points earned” for “rewards”.
