# Endless Math
A web application intended to allow users to practice simple mathematics “endlessly”. 

## Setup
You will need python 3.x installed.
In the terminal enter `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Run `endlessMath.py` in your favourite IDE.

## Overview
This project began as a way to practice coding in python outside of my studies. I chose to create a mathematics "game” to help my younger siblings practice their mathematics. They are both in their early primaries, and so the mathematics portion of the code did not need to be too complex. Simple addition and subtraction are currently the only functions, but I hope to expand on this in the future.

The code will prompt the user to input the number values they wish to work with. This allows the user to modify the difficulty through adjusting the value of the numbers they work with. The code then prompts the user to set how many questions they wish to answer. Each question will continue to trigger until the correct answer is given or the user exits the program.

This project is currently in development. I hope to apply what I continue to learn about full stack web application development to this project. I intend to create a more engaging, accessible, and interactive user interface for my current code to work through. Additionally, creating a server-side database to save and store user credentials/scores would allow me to implement a system of trading “points earned” for “rewards”. It is my goal that both features would allow me to increase engagement with the program, to the benefit of the users.
