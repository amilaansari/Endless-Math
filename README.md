# Endless Math
A web application intended to allow users to practice simple mathematics “endlessly”. 

This project began as a way to practice coding in python outside of my studies. I chose to create a mathematics "game” to help my younger siblings practice their mathematics. They are both in their early primaries, and so the mathematics portion of the code did not need to be too complex. Simple addition and subtraction and allowing them to choose how big or small the numbers they worked with were sufficient.

This project is currently in development. I hope to apply what I continue to learn about full stack web application development to this project. I intend to create a more engaging, accessible, and interactive user interface for my current code to work through. Additionally, creating a server-side database to save and store user credentials/scores would allow me to implement a system of trading “points earned” for “rewards”. It is my goal that both features would allow me to increase engagement with the program, to the benefit of the users.
